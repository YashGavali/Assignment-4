                </h2>
                <p>Compilation of bibliographies, reading lists and state of the art reports is one of the most important aspects of LIS work, particularly in research and academic libraries. Browsing through the manual indexes and abstracts is a tedious and time consuming work, and does not always produce up-to-date result. Availability of databases in electronic form on CD-ROM or Services online, offers convenient, efficient and cost effective information retrieval. Electronic databases also provide unique search features such as searching on multiple criteria (keyword, subject, author, source, classification code, year of publication, Language, etc.), and variety of display formats and styles. Advance features like natural language query, ranking the search results, are also available in many databases. Web-based services facilitate full-text searches and links to full-text documents. Dialog, STN and Silver Platter are some of the popular database companies that offer bibliographic and reference databases on CD-ROM and online platforms.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Audio-visual materials are important sources of information, education and entertainment. Many libraries particularly media libraries and large academic and public libraries hold audio-visual material such as music, films, pictures and photographs, etc. Old media of LP records and tape slide have long been replaced with audio and video tape. The new multimedia of audio CD, Video CD (VCD), and Digital Video Disks (DVD) have advantage of higher storage capacity, random access and longer life than audio and video tapes and cassettes. Many libraries allow their members to borrow these. Multimedia documents can now be played on standard PCs, stand-alone or networked.

                    Recent developments in storage media, compression and encryption technology have made it possible to store large amount of multimedia documents on hard disk and disseminate through Internet. Software such as Quick Time Player, Microsoft Media Player, etc. is now freely available to play or see these documents in a browser. You will learn more about various hardware, software and document formats that are used for creation, storage, distribution and use of digital multimedia documents later in this course.</p>
